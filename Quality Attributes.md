# AIDAP Quality Attributes and System Constraints

This document outlines the key quality attributes (non-functional requirements) and system constraints for the AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP), based on the project requirements.

## Quality Attributes

Quality attributes define *how well* the system should perform its functions.

### Performance and Latency
The system must be responsive and efficient under load.
* [cite_start]**Response Time:** It must respond to student queries within **2 seconds** on average under normal load[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Load Handling:** It must support scalability to handle up to **5,000 concurrent users**[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Monitoring:** Performance metrics for AI model accuracy and latency must be logged[cite: 17].

### Availability and Reliability
The system must be operational and dependable.
* [cite_start]**Uptime:** The system must remain available **99.5%** of the time per month[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**High Availability:** It must provide high availability, including automatic **fail-over and backup recovery** mechanisms[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Graceful Failure:** It must handle failures in data source availability gracefully, with **retry and recovery** processes[cite: 19].
* [cite_start]**Deployment:** Updates must be deployable with **zero downtime**[cite: 17].

### Security
The system must protect user data and control access.
* [cite_start]**Data Protection:** It must protect user data[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Authentication:** Students must authenticate securely through the institution's **single sign-on (SSO)**[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Access Control (Students):** Student-specific data must be visible **only to the authenticated user**[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Access Control (Lecturers):** **Only authorized lecturers** can modify course data[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Access Control (Maintenance):** It must support **role-based access** for maintenance operations[cite: 17].

### Usability and Accessibility
The system must be intuitive and easy to interact with across different platforms.
* [cite_start]**Conversational Interface:** The core function is providing **conversational access** to data[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Interaction Modes:** It must support both **text and voice** interaction modes[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Device Accessibility:** It must be accessible on **mobile, web, and voice-assistant devices**[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**UI Design:** The system must have an **intuitive UI** consistent with conversational design best practices[cite: 11].

### Scalability
The system must be able to grow to meet increased demand.
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** It must be deployable as a **scalable service**[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**User Load:** It must support scaling up to **5,000 concurrent users**[cite: 15].

### Maintainability and Extensibility
The system must be easy to update, monitor, and expand.
* [cite_start]**Monitoring:** It must provide **monitoring dashboards** for system health, latency, and errors[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Extensibility:** It must be **easily extensible** to integrate new AI services or external data sources[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Configuration:** Maintainers must be able to configure AI model versions and API keys[cite: 17].
* [cite_start]**Deployment:** It must use **continuous deployment pipelines** for updates[cite: 17].

### Interoperability
The system must successfully connect and exchange data with other systems.
* [cite_start]**Integration:** It must integrate with existing data sources like **registration, LMS, and calendars**[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Synchronization:** It must synchronize data with connected university systems at **configurable intervals**[cite: 19].

### Personalization and Adaptability
The system should adapt to individual user needs.
* [cite_start]**History:** It must store **historical interactions** for personalization[cite: 8].
* [cite_start]**Learning:** It must **learn from previous conversations** to improve response relevance[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Preferences:** Students must be able to change preferences for notifications and language[cite: 11].

### Other Attributes
* [cite_start]**Localization:** It must support **multi-language queries** and responses[cite: 10].
* [cite_start]**Offline Capability:** It must support an **offline cache** of recent responses for limited connectivity[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]**Data Integrity:** It must maintain data integrity and consistency across systems[cite: 19].
